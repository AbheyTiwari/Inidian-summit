            THE INDIAN SUMMIT is not just a conference designed to bring together
            delegates from around the country to engage in debates on ongoing and
            emerging issues, this conference uniquely aims to celebrate and revive
            INDIAN CULTURE in an era where globalization, epitomized by the
            "McDonaldization" phenomenon, has led to the diminishing of our rich
            cultural heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Latterly, there's an urgent need to reconnect with our roots and promote
            our cultural. The Indian Summit addresses this need by fostering a
            platform where the essence of Indian culture is at the forefront. The
            theme for this year, "THE CULTURE SAYS EVERYTHING?", encapsulates our
            vision to enrich and promote cultural awareness through various engaging
            activities.

            With a mission in confluence with the GREEN INITIATIVE, the Indian
            Summit shall be a completely ZERO PLASTIC event, promoting green
            initiatives and showcasing eco-friendly practices. Our dedication to the
            environment underscores our belief that cultural preservation and
            environmental stewardship go hand in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The summit will feature a diverse range of activities designed to
            inspire confidence in emerging minds and encourage public speaking
            ranging from the evergreen heated debates to lightening activities. This
            initiative not only aims to contribute to nation-building through
            cultural preservation and enhancement but also ensuring that emerging
            carries forward the legacy of Indian culture with renewed vigor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Join us at the Indian Summit, where we celebrate the past, present, and
            future of Indian culture and prove that “YES, THE CULTURE SAYS
            EVERYTHING”…
